# Specialized Industrial Zones

# Alpha version
This is the alpha version of the mod, see [Specialized Industrial Zones](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/106939/Windows) for the stable version.

This version is unstable and may contain bugs.

# 0.3-alpha updates

## Custom zones

The zone types are now driven by a JSON file in the mod data folder - `C:\Users\{user}\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\SpecializedZones\SpecializedZones.json`.

You can edit this file and the game will live update. **NOTE THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!** 

Current limitations:
* If you delete or change the ID of a zone, any placements of that zone will have the same behaviour as when uninstalling the mod
  * The zone is removed, buildings change to white boxes and get flagged as condemned, eventually auto-demolished.
* There is no UI yet but that is planned before 0.3 final release.
* JSON file schema is subject to change.
* Commercial zones can be used as the base zones, but haven't been tested much yet.
  * They can be used by setting `BaseZoneName` to e.g. `NA Commercial Low`.
  * The mod logs all available base zone names during initialization, Skyve is recommended for viewing (search `SpecializedIndustryZones.Mod`).
  * Other zone types such as `Office High` can be used too, but there's zero testing for those.
* If defined, `IconUri` has to point to a valid file in the game's internal UI host; you can leave it out of the definition to inherit the base zone's icon.
* When you update filters, any non-conforming buildings that have spawned will see the companies move out and eventually get marked as abandoned.
  * Note the game does not automatically demolish abandoned buildings.
